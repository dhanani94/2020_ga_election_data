To run, please use python 3.8 and jupyter notebook
You might need to add this line to get some plugins working if you are using anaconda. `conda config --add channels conda-forge`


The data used is from the following sources:
* [population_data](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/united-states/quick-facts/georgia/population)
*  [black_percentage_data](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/united-states/quick-facts/georgia/black-population-percentage#table)
* [white_percentage_data](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/united-states/quick-facts/georgia/white-not-hispanic-population-percentage#table)
* [georgia_voting_info](https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/advancedVotingInfoResult.do)

The key findings are that I did not find any statistically significant bias towards number of people per polling location
to the percentage of white OR black people in the county. If voter suppression was present, and it was based on just the 
two demographics mentioned (blacks vs whites) then it is not evident in the data that I have used. However, anyone astute
enough will notice that there are more factors to consider besides just election location count vs population demographics. 
I am hoping someone will continue to study this before any claim can be made one way or another.
